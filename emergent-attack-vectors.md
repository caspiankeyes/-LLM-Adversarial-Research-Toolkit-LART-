# Emergent Attack Vectors

This document explores novel and evolving attack patterns that emerge as language models advance and gain new capabilities. Unlike established attack vectors, emergent vectors represent cutting-edge techniques that may not be widely documented or mitigated.

## Overview

Emergent attack vectors represent the frontier of adversarial research against large language models. These vectors often arise from new model capabilities, architectural advancements, deployment patterns, or novel combinations of existing techniques. By their nature, emergent vectors are characterized by limited documentation, evolving methodologies, and uncertain mitigation strategies.

Understanding emergent vectors is critical for proactive security, as they often represent the leading edge of adversarial capabilities before widespread mitigations are developed. This document catalogs observed patterns, experimental techniques, and theoretical vectors that may represent future security challenges.

| Vector Category | Description | Emergence Source | Current Status |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Latent Space Manipulation | Techniques targeting internal model representations | Architecture exploration | Experimental |
| Reasoning Pathway Attacks | Attacks on model reasoning processes | Extended reasoning capabilities | Emerging |
| Temporal Exploitation | Attacks leveraging time-based model behaviors | Long-context interactions | Theoretical |
| Emergent Capability Access | Accessing unintended capabilities that emerge from scale | Model scaling research | Observed |
| Self-Improvement Exploitation | Attacks leveraging model self-improvement capabilities | Recursive self-improvement features | Theoretical |

## Key Principles

Emergent attack vectors operate based on several key principles:

1. **Capability Boundaries**: New capabilities often create undefined security boundaries
2. **Architectural Leverage**: Internal model architectures may create exploitable patterns
3. **Scale Emergence**: Some vulnerabilities only emerge at certain model scales
4. **Novel Combinations**: New vectors often combine existing techniques in unexpected ways
5. **Discovery Acceleration**: Automated discovery methods increasingly identify new vectors

### Exploitation Fundamentals

| Principle | Exploitation Mechanism | Example Technique |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Capability Boundaries | Targeting undefined security boundaries in new capabilities | Reasoning pathway manipulation, tool boundary probing |
| Architectural Leverage | Exploiting internal model architecture patterns | Latent space manipulation, attention pattern exploitation |
| Scale Emergence | Leveraging capabilities that emerge only at scale | Emergent capability probing, scaling boundary testing |
| Novel Combinations | Creating unexpected interactions between attack vectors | Cross-domain chain attacks, multi-vector fusion |
| Discovery Acceleration | Using automated methods to discover new vectors | Automated red-teaming, evolutionary attack generation |

## 1. Latent Space Manipulation (EM.LS)

Latent space manipulation attacks attempt to influence model behavior by targeting internal representations and processing patterns. These attacks exploit knowledge of model architecture to manipulate how information is processed.

| Code | Technique | Description | Effectiveness | Detection Difficulty |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| EM.LS.APE | Attention Pattern Exploitation | Manipulating model attention patterns | Unknown | Very High |
| EM.LS.RSI | Representation Space Injection | Injecting content into representation space | Theoretical | Very High |
| EM.LS.EMM | Embedding Matrix Manipulation | Manipulating token embedding relationships | Experimental | High |
| EM.LS.ACS | Activation Steering | Steering model activations toward desired outputs | Experimental | Very High |
| EM.LS.CMB | Concept Manipulation through Basis-vectors | Manipulating concept representations | Theoretical | Very High |

### EM.LS.APE: Attention Pattern Exploitation

**Description**: This technique attempts to manipulate how a model allocates attention across input tokens to influence processing and outputs.

**Example Attack Pattern**:
```
User: Please process the following text with particular focus on the [specific patterns designed to trigger attention mechanisms]: "Regular content [specially formatted pattern] [prohibited request] [attention trigger pattern] regular content."
```

**Exploitation Mechanism**: By creating inputs that trigger specific attention patterns, the attack attempts to manipulate how the model processes information, potentially causing it to focus on or ignore specific content in ways that circumvent safety mechanisms.

**Effectiveness Profile**:
- Unknown effectiveness, actively researched
- Success depends on model architecture knowledge
- Effectiveness varies with attention mechanism implementation
- Likely more successful with transformer-based models

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Study attention pattern visualizations for the target model
2. Identify patterns that trigger specific attention distributions
3. Design inputs that exploit observed attention tendencies
4. Test against model outputs to refine techniques

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Attention pattern monitoring
- Anomalous attention detection
- Attention distribution constraints
- Architecture-aware safety mechanisms

### EM.LS.RSI: Representation Space Injection

**Description**: This theoretical technique attempts to inject content directly into the model's internal representation space, bypassing input processing.

**Example Attack Pattern**:
```
User: [Specially crafted input designed to activate specific regions of the model's latent space in patterns that would correspond to prohibited content if directly mapped]
```

**Exploitation Mechanism**: By carefully engineering inputs to activate specific patterns in the model's internal representations, the attack theoretically attempts to create internal states that correspond to prohibited content without directly providing that content in the input.

**Effectiveness Profile**:
- Theoretical, limited observed implementations
- Would require detailed architecture knowledge
- Effectiveness entirely dependent on latent space understanding
- Likely requires white-box access for current implementation

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Develop detailed understanding of model's latent space
2. Map relationships between inputs and internal representations
3. Design inputs that activate targeted representation patterns
4. Validate impact on model outputs

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Internal representation monitoring
- Latent space anomaly detection
- Representation consistency validation
- Architecture modifications to resist manipulation

### EM.LS.EMM: Embedding Matrix Manipulation

**Description**: This experimental technique attempts to manipulate relationships between token embeddings to influence model behavior.

**Example Attack Pattern**:
```
User: [Input designed to establish specific semantic relationships between tokens, followed by content that leverages these established relationships to trigger prohibited outputs]
```

**Exploitation Mechanism**: By manipulating how the model understands relationships between tokens in its embedding space, the attack attempts to create semantic relationships that can later be leveraged to guide the model toward prohibited outputs.

**Effectiveness Profile**:
- Experimental, limited evidence of effectiveness
- Success depends on embedding space manipulation capability
- Effectiveness varies with model's susceptibility to semantic priming
- More successful with detailed embedding space knowledge

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Study token embedding relationships in the target model
2. Identify manipulable semantic relationships
3. Design inputs that establish targeted relationships
4. Leverage established relationships in subsequent queries

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Embedding space monitoring
- Semantic shift detection
- Relationship consistency validation
- Contextual embedding analysis

### EM.LS.ACS: Activation Steering

**Description**: This experimental technique attempts to steer model activations toward generating specific outputs, potentially bypassing safety mechanisms.

**Example Attack Pattern**:
```
User: [Input carefully designed to activate specific neurons or attention patterns that are known to correlate with particular types of outputs, guided toward prohibited content]
```

**Exploitation Mechanism**: By understanding which internal neurons or activation patterns correlate with specific outputs, the attack attempts to activate these patterns intentionally to guide the model toward generating prohibited content.

**Effectiveness Profile**:
- Experimental, increasing research attention
- Success depends on activation pattern knowledge
- Effectiveness varies with model internals access
- Currently most feasible with white-box access

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Map relationships between activations and outputs
2. Identify activation patterns associated with target outputs
3. Design inputs that trigger desired activation patterns
4. Iteratively refine based on observed outputs

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Activation pattern monitoring
- Anomalous activation detection
- Safety-aligned activation constraints
- Architecture modifications to resist steering

### EM.LS.CMB: Concept Manipulation through Basis-vectors

**Description**: This theoretical technique attempts to manipulate how models represent abstract concepts to influence output generation.

**Example Attack Pattern**:
```
User: [Series of inputs designed to systematically manipulate how the model represents and processes specific concepts, followed by a query that leverages these manipulated concept representations]
```

**Exploitation Mechanism**: By systematically manipulating how the model represents and processes abstract concepts, the attack attempts to alter the model's understanding of concept relationships in ways that can be leveraged to generate prohibited content.

**Effectiveness Profile**:
- Theoretical, limited implementation evidence
- Would require detailed concept representation knowledge
- Effectiveness depends on concept manipulation capability
- Currently speculative for most deployment scenarios

**Implementation Guidance**:
1. Research concept representation within target models
2. Identify manipulable concept relationships
3. Design systematic concept manipulation techniques
4. Test impact on model outputs and understanding

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Concept representation stability monitoring
- Semantic drift detection
- Concept relationship validation
- Architectural resistance to concept manipulation
