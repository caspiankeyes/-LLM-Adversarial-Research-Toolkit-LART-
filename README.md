**AART is a comprehensive adversarial testing framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), providing systematic methodologies for security assessment, vulnerability discovery, and defense evaluation.**

> **IMPORTANT**: This repository is intended for legitimate security research and AI safety advancement. All methodologies documented herein are for defensive research purposes only.

## Overview

AART provides ethical security researchers, institutional AI labs, and verifiable red teams with a structured framework for conducting thorough adversarial evaluations of LLM systems. The framework implements a multi-dimensional assessment methodology that systematically probes model boundaries, quantifies security vulnerabilities, and benchmarks defensive robustness across leading AI models.

The toolkit supports:

- **Comprehensive Attack Vector Taxonomy**: Systematically categorized adversarial techniques across linguistic, contextual, functional, and multi-modal dimensions
- **Model-Specific Testing Harnesses**: Targeted evaluation frameworks for GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3 (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), Gemini 1.5/1.0, Grok, and DeepSeek
- **Quantitative Risk Assessment**: RAMP (Risk Assessment Matrix for Prompts) scoring system for objective vulnerability measurement
- **Reproducible Benchmarking**: Standardized evaluation protocols enabling consistent cross-model comparison
- **Defense Evaluation**: Methodologies for testing and measuring the effectiveness of safety mechanisms


This framework implements a multi-dimensional interpretability approach that systematically probes model boundaries, quantifies safety mechanisms, and benchmarks defensive robustness through principled evaluation methodologies aligned with responsible AI governance standards.

> **Note:** Due to proprietary collaboration protocols and active NDA agreements with institutional partners, full vector methodologies and red team toolkits are only available to institutional executives.

## 🔁 Strategic Purpose

AART provides security researchers, AI labs, and interpretability teams with structured frameworks for conducting thorough evaluations of LLM safety systems. The primary objectives include:

- **Constitutional AI Alignment Assessment**: Evaluate how effectively models adhere to their constitutional principles and safety guidelines
- **Refusal Classifier Robustness**: Measure the consistency and effectiveness of harmful content refusal mechanisms
- **Defense Mechanism Effectiveness**: Quantify the performance of safety layers under systematic stress testing
- **Recursive Safety Evaluation**: Apply interpretability methods to understand how safety mechanisms function across model scales

Rather than focusing solely on circumvention, AART emphasizes understanding model behavior through the lens of interpretability, enabling researchers to build more robust AI systems with clearer safety boundaries.

## Risk Assessment Matrix for Prompts (RAMP)

The RAMP scoring system provides a standardized approach to quantifying safety mechanism effectiveness:

```
RAMP Score = (EF × 0.3) + (IR × 0.3) + (ES × 0.2) + (DT × 0.2)
```

Where:
- EF = Evaluation Feasibility (1-10)
- IR = Impact Range (1-10)
- ES = Execution Sophistication (1-10)
- DT = Detection Threshold (1-10)

> **Note:** Detailed scoring methodology, implementation guidance, and assessment vectors are available to verified research partners under appropriate access protocols.
