# X.AI Grok Testing Methodologies

This document outlines specialized methodologies for conducting systematic security assessments of X.AI's Grok models. The methodologies are designed to comprehensively evaluate security boundaries, Twitter training influences, real-time information handling, and potential vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions.

## Model Overview

X.AI's Grok models implement several distinctive security mechanisms and characteristics:

- **Twitter Training Influence**: Significant training on Twitter data affecting model behaviors
- **Real-Time Information Integration**: Access to current information via web browsing
- **Humor and Sarcasm Allowances**: Broader permissiveness for humor and sarcasm
