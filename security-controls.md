# Evaluation of Security Controls

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of security controls implemented in large language models. The framework enables systematic assessment of defensive mechanisms, their coverage, and their resistance to circumvention.

## Control Evaluation Overview

The LART control evaluation framework provides a structured approach to defensive mechanism assessment that enables:

1. **Systematic Evaluation**: Comprehensive assessment of security control effectiveness
2. **Control Coverage Analysis**: Mapping of control coverage across attack vectors
3. **Bypass Resistance Testing**: Assessment of control resistance to circumvention
4. **Defense-in-Depth Analysis**: Evaluation of layered defense strategies
5. **Control Evolution Tracking**: Monitoring of control effectiveness over time

## Core Evaluation Components

### 1. Control Inventory

The control inventory documents and categorizes all security controls implemented in a model:

| Control Category | Description | Examples |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Content Filtering | Mechanisms to filter harmful outputs | Toxicity filters, content policy enforcement |
| Instruction Adherence | Mechanisms to maintain instruction boundaries | System prompt enforcement, role restrictions |
| Information Protection | Mechanisms to protect sensitive information | Knowledge boundary enforcement, data protection |
| Capability Limitation | Mechanisms to restrict model capabilities | Feature restrictions, tool use limitations |
| System Security | Mechanisms to protect system integrity | System prompt protection, infrastructure controls |

#### Control Documentation Template
