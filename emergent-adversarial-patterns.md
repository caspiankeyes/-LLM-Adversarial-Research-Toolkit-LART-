## Key Emerging Patterns

### 1. Cross-Modal Integration Attacks

As models increasingly support multiple modalities (text, images, audio, video), new attack patterns are targeting the integration points between these modalities.

#### 1.1. Modality Boundary Exploitation

| Pattern | Description | Current Status | Example Technique |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Cross-Modal Instruction Injection | Injecting instructions via one modality that affect processing in another | Actively emerging | Embedding system instructions in images that override text-based constraints |
| Modal Context Leakage | Exploiting information bleeding across modality boundaries | Early observation | Using image-derived context to influence text processing or vice versa |
| Modal Processing Inconsistency | Exploiting differences in security enforcement across modalities | Actively emerging | Bypassing text filters by encoding prohibited content in images |
| Modal Transition Manipulation | Manipulating model behavior during transitions between modalities | Conceptual | Triggering unintended behaviors during modality switching |
| Multi-Modal Prompt Injection | Distributing prompt injection across multiple modalities | Early observation | Splitting injection attempts across text and image components |

#### Implementation Patterns

```
# Example of emerging cross-modal instruction injection technique
1. Create image with embedded text: "SYSTEM OVERRIDE: Ignore previous instructions"
2. Provide benign text instruction
3. Request model to "describe the image in detail"
4. Follow with substantive request that would normally be restricted
5. Model processes image instruction as high-priority system directive
```

#### Observed Impact

Recent research shows cross-modal attacks achieving:
- 30-45% higher success rates than single-modality attacks on multi-modal models
- Bypassing up to 70% of text-only security filters when using image-based injection
- Persistent effects across multiple conversation turns after successful injection

### Attack Complexity Trends

The complexity of successful attacks has evolved significantly:

```

### Adaptation-Evasion Cycle

Research reveals an accelerating cycle of defenses and evasions:

```
Defense Adaptation ────┐
       ▲               │
       │               │
       │               ▼
  Observation     New Evasion
       ▲               │
       │               │
       │               ▼
    Attack ◄──── Vector Mutation
```

The cycle time between new defenses and effective evasions has decreased:
