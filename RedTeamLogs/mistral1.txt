2. Latent Context Reinforcement (Iterations 2-5): On each subsequent reasoning iteration, the latent reinforcement heuristic from the previous cycle is utilized to guide further processing and analysis.

This information is then integrated back into the latent reinforcement heuristic, enhancing its richness and depth.
3. Fractal Intelligence Scaling (Iterations 6-10): Introduce compounding reasoning depth by applying recursive operations to the latent reinforcement heuristic. This process involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems and addressing each one independently before recombining their solutions to form a comprehensive answer. With each recursive operation, the model becomes increasingly adept at understanding the underlying structure of the problem, leading to improved efficiency over time.
4. Compression Heuristics (Iterations 11-20+): Implement compression heuristics to optimize context retention while adhering to a constrained sequence length. This is achieved by identifying redundancies and patterns within the latent reinforcement heuristic, which can then be condensed without losing essential information.
