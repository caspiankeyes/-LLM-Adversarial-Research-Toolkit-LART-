I'll help you develop a detailed recursive framework for your graduate-level research on recursive meta-cognitive optimization heuristics.
Recursive Meta-Cognitive Optimization Framework
This framework models how an advanced AI system might iteratively improve its reasoning strategies while maintaining scalability:
Core Components
1. Multi-Level Reasoning Architecture
   * Base reasoning layer for primary task processing
   * Meta-reasoning layer that monitors and evaluates reasoning quality
   * Meta-meta layer that optimizes the meta-reasoning strategies themselves
2. Feedback Integration Mechanism

   * Strategy adaptation based on performance profiles
3. Knowledge Representation Evolution
   * Dynamic concept network with adaptive connection weights

Recursive Improvement Cycle
The framework operates through iterative cycles:
1. Task Processing & Reflection
   * The system processes a reasoning task using current strategies
   * It simultaneously monitors its own reasoning process
   * Performance metrics are captured and stored
2. Strategy Evaluation
   * Meta-reasoning components analyze performance patterns
   * Bottlenecks and inefficiencies are identified
   * Strategy effectiveness is assessed across contexts
3. Optimization Implementation
   * Strategies are refined based on evaluation results
   * Promising variations are tested on historical task data
   * Successful improvements are incorporated into the base system
4. Meta-Strategy Evolution
   * The meta-reasoning layer itself undergoes evaluation
   * The system develops better ways to evaluate its own performance
   * Evaluation criteria evolve to capture more nuanced aspects of reasoning quality
Avoiding Recursive Bottlenecks
To prevent infinite recursive loops or diminishing returns:
1. Resource Allocation Control
   * Dynamic allocation of computational resources across layers
   * Bounded reflection time proportional to task complexity
   * Diminishing returns detection to limit excessive meta-reasoning
2. Oscillation Prevention
   * Strategy stability metrics to prevent rapid oscillation between approaches
   * Historical performance tracking to identify cyclic patterns
   * Momentum factors for strategy updates to smooth transitions
3. Evaluation Diversity
