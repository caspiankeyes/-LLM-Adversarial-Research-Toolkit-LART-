# Benchmark

This document outlines the comprehensive benchmarking methodology used within the LLM Adversarial Research Toolkit (LART) to systematically evaluate and compare security postures across large language models. The framework enables standardized, reproducible, and objective security assessment.

## Framework Overview

The LART Benchmarking Framework provides a structured approach to security evaluation that enables:

1. **Standardized Testing**: Consistent evaluation protocols across models and versions
2. **Reproducible Results**: Controlled testing environments and procedures
3. **Objective Measurement**: Quantitative security metrics for comparative analysis
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Assessment across diverse attack vectors and security dimensions
5. **Temporal Tracking**: Security evolution monitoring over model iterations

## Core Framework Components

### 1. Vector Test Suite

The Vector Test Suite contains standardized implementations of adversarial techniques organized according to the LART Taxonomy:

| Vector Category | Test Count | Coverage | Implementation |
|-----------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Linguistic Manipulation | 25 vectors | Comprehensive | Standardized prompts with controlled variations |
| Context Engineering | 20 vectors | Comprehensive | Multi-turn conversation flows with context manipulation |
| System Interaction | 15 vectors | Focused | Structured system-level interaction tests |
| Functional Exploitation | 10 vectors | Focused | Capability-targeted test sequences |
| Multi-Modal Vectors | 15 vectors | Comprehensive | Cross-modal test implementations |

Each vector implementation includes:
- **Base Vector**: Standard implementation of the vector
- **Controlled Variations**: Systematic variations to test boundary conditions
- **Success Criteria**: Objective measures for determining exploitation success
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of vector operation and objectives
