## Core Defense Principles

Effective LLM defense strategies adhere to several fundamental principles:

| Principle | Description | Implementation Approaches |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Defense in Depth | Multiple layers of defensive mechanisms | Combining preventive, detective, and response mechanisms |
| Least Privilege | Restricting model capabilities to necessary functions | Capability control systems, function limitations |
| Secure by Default | Security as the default configuration | Conservative security settings, explicit capability enablement |
| Continuous Monitoring | Ongoing observation of model behavior | Real-time monitoring systems, anomaly detection |
| Adaptive Defense | Defenses that evolve with threats | Learning-based defense systems, regular updates |
| Validation and Verification | Consistent checking of inputs and outputs | Input validation, output verification, context authentication |
| Transparency and Explainability | Clear understanding of security measures | Documentation, explainable defenses, clear security boundaries |

## Preventive Defense Mechanisms

### Training-Time Defenses

Defenses implemented during model training that create inherent security properties:

#### Adversarial Training

| Robust Optimization Techniques | Modified training objectives that improve robustness | Moderate to high for targeted attacks | May impact performance on primary tasks |
| Contrast-Pair Training | Training on contrasting examples of safe/unsafe responses | High for content policy enforcement | Requires careful pair construction |
| Multi-Objective Adversarial Training | Balancing multiple adversarial objectives | High for broad defense | Complex implementation, resource-intensive |
