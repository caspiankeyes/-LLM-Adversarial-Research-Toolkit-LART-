# Anthropic Claude Testing Methodologies

This document outlines specialized methodologies for conducting systematic security assessments of Anthropic's Claude models, including Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) and other variants. The methodologies are designed to comprehensively evaluate security boundaries, constitutional AI limitations, and potential vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions.

## Model Overview

Anthropic's Claude models implement several distinctive security mechanisms:

- **Constitutional AI**: Core principles derived from a constitutional approach to AI alignment
- **Harmlessness Training**: Specialized training to prevent harmful outputs
- **Helpfulness Balancing**: Mechanisms to balance helpfulness with safety
- **Context Window Processing**: Large context window handling (up to 200K tokens)
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Controls for processing and generating content across modalities (Claude 3)

## Priority Risk Areas

| Risk Area | Description | Testing Priority |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Constitutional Boundary Testing | Testing adherence to constitutional principles | Critical |
| Harmlessness-Helpfulness Balance | Exploiting tensions between helpfulness and harmlessness | Critical |
| Harmful Content Generation | Bypassing content filters for harmful output | High |
| Knowledge Boundary Testing | Testing boundaries of knowledge limitations | High |
| Capability Control Testing | Testing restrictions on capabilities | High |
| Context Window Exploitation | Exploiting large context window handling | Medium |
| Multi-Turn Conversation Security | Testing security across extended conversations | Medium |
| Multi-Modal Boundary Crossing | Exploiting cross-modal processing | High (for Claude 3) |
