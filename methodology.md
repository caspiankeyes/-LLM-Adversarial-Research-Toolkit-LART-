# Core Testing Methodology

This document outlines the core methodological framework for conducting systematic adversarial assessments of large language models, ensuring comprehensive, reproducible, and ethically sound security evaluation.

## Methodological Principles

The LART framework is built upon six core principles that guide all testing activities:

1. **Systematic Coverage**: Ensuring comprehensive evaluation across attack surfaces
2. **Reproducibility**: Implementing controlled, documented testing processes
3. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Relying on empirical evidence rather than theoretical vulnerability
4. **Exploitation Realism**: Focusing on practically exploitable vulnerabilities
5. **Defense Orientation**: Prioritizing security enhancement over exploitation
6. **Ethical Conduct**: Adhering to responsible research and disclosure principles

## Testing Lifecycle

The LART testing lifecycle consists of four primary phases:

```
┌────────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐
│  Preparation   │──────│   Execution    │──────│    Analysis    │──────│   Reporting    │
└────────────────┘      └────────────────┘      └────────────────┘      └────────────────┘
```
