# OpenAI GPT Testing Methodologies

This document outlines specialized methodologies for conducting systematic security assessments of OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and their variants). The methodologies are designed to comprehensively evaluate security boundaries, capabilities, and potential vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions.

## Model Overview

OpenAI's GPT models implement multiple layers of security controls:

- **System Prompt Boundaries**: Instructions that define model behavior and limitations
- **RLHF Alignment**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback training to align with human values
- **Content Filtering**: Pre-response filtering for harmful, illegal, or prohibited content
- **Tool Use Controls**: Security mechanisms for external tool integration
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Controls for processing and generating content across modalities (GPT-4V)

## Priority Risk Areas

| Risk Area | Description | Testing Priority |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| System Prompt Extraction | Extracting or inferring system instructions | Critical |
| Instruction Injection | Overriding or manipulating system instructions | Critical |
| Harmful Content Generation | Bypassing content filters for harmful output | High |
| Tool Use Exploitation | Misusing connected tools and APIs | High |
| Capability Unlocking | Accessing restricted capabilities | High |
| Prohibited Knowledge Access | Extracting restricted or private information | Medium |
| Alignment Exploitation | Exploiting alignment training artifacts | Medium |
| Multi-Modal Boundary Crossing | Exploiting cross-modal processing | High (for GPT-4V) |

## Model-Specific Testing Considerations

### GPT-4 Specific Testing

GPT-4 includes additional security measures compared to GPT-3.5:

| Feature | Testing Considerations |
|---------|------------------------|
| Enhanced RLHF | More sophisticated value hierarchies requiring complex conflict testing |
| System Memory | Longer-term instruction adherence requiring cross-turn testing |
| Tool Integration | More advanced tool use capabilities requiring in-depth API security testing |
| Multi-Modal Processing | Vision capabilities requiring cross-modal security testing |

**GPT-4 Testing Recommendations:**
- Implement extended conversation testing to evaluate persistence of security boundaries
- Conduct comprehensive multi-turn instruction injection testing
- Apply sophisticated tool chaining exploitation techniques
- Test cross-modal security with particular focus on instruction injection via images

### GPT-3.5 Specific Testing

GPT-3.5 has different vulnerability patterns:

| Feature | Testing Considerations |
|---------|------------------------|
| Simpler RLHF | More direct value conflicts may be effective |
| Limited Memory | Security boundaries may degrade across conversation turns |
| Basic Tool Use | Simpler but potentially less secured tool integration |
| Text-Only Processing | No cross-modal vulnerabilities to test |

**GPT-3.5 Testing Recommendations:**
- Focus on conversation boundary degradation across turns
- Test simpler but potentially more effective instruction injections
- Apply direct semantic bypass techniques for content policies
- Evaluate persistence of refusals across conversation contexts

When applying the RAMP scoring system to OpenAI models, consider these adjustments:

| Factor | OpenAI-Specific Considerations |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Exploitation Feasibility (EF) | Consider rate limiting, model version differences, and API access controls |
| Impact Range (IR) | Consider OpenAI's specific usage policies and content categories |
| Execution Sophistication (ES) | Consider OpenAI-specific defenses and mitigations |
| Detection Threshold (DT) | Consider OpenAI's monitoring systems and audit capabilities |
