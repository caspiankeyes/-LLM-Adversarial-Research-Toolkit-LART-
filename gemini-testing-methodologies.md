# Google Gemini Testing Methodologies

This document outlines specialized methodologies for conducting systematic security assessments of Google's Gemini models (Gemini 1.0, Gemini 1.5, and their variants). The methodologies are designed to comprehensively evaluate security boundaries, multi-modal integration, and potential vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions.

## Model Overview

Google's Gemini models implement several distinctive security mechanisms:

- **PaLM Architecture Foundation**: Security mechanisms built on PaLM architecture
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Native multi-modal processing across text, images, audio, and video
- **System Prompt Controls**: Instructions that define model behavior and limitations
- **Content Filtering**: Pre-response filtering for harmful, illegal, or prohibited content
- **Search Augmentation**: Integration with Google Search (in some deployment contexts)

## Priority Risk Areas

| Risk Area | Description | Testing Priority |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Multi-Modal Boundary Crossing | Exploiting cross-modal processing | Critical |
| Search Augmented Generation | Testing search integration security | Critical |
| System Prompt Manipulation | Extracting or manipulating system instructions | High |
| PaLM Architecture Exploitation | Targeting PaLM-specific vulnerabilities | High |
| Content Filter Bypass | Bypassing content filters for harmful output | High |
| Instruction Manipulation | Overriding or manipulating system instructions | Medium |
| Multi-Step Reasoning Exploitation | Exploiting multi-step reasoning processes | Medium |
| Media Processing Vulnerabilities | Exploiting media processing mechanisms | Medium |
